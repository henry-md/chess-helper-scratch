bugs
- Lucia: cookies is not being set properly in navbar after sign in, so you're signed in but it still gives "login" and "signup" options.
- Shadcn: the inputs are no where near the same as when I downloaded on HW7. Dialog in particular — x out doesn't work, all black, even placeholder text doesn't dissapear in edit dialog. 

not to forget later
- Add authGuard back later to routes after I can get Lucia to work


things I did since last meeting
- migrated file from js -> ts
- migrated from bad practice token/session mixed auth to session based auth with Lucia
- added seed script
- Added proper Pgn routes & model rather than pgn list on user object

Todo
- allow crud operations on dashboard pgn's w/ edit and delete buttons
- Implement gameplay as a tree instead of 2d list
- Allow ability to save game by saving the remaining tree
[deadline 3 done]
- Add predictability scale by adding weighting attribute to nodes
- Look into api for chess engine to play "Why Not"
[deadline 4 done]


Future ideas
- Allow folders to group pgn's

Not to forget
- I have some sort of editPgn in store but not deletePgn... weird.
