Bugs

Todo
- Add the http request that happens in <Game> to a hook.
- migrate frontend to ts
  https://www.typescriptlang.org/
  https://tsx.is/

Future ideas
- Allow folders to group pgn's

Did since last meeting
- implemented pure token-based auth (for mobile compatibility) on separate demo app & integrated
- refactored lots of state in the app with nanostore & state; implemented game view that loads pgn from url

Things to ask in next meeting
- How do you suggest I migrate backend to ts
- Do you think I could separate the code in components/chess-app.tsx so that it's less cluttered?
