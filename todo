bugs
- Lucia: cookies is not being set properly in navbar after sign in, so you're signed in but it still gives "login" and "signup" options.

not to forget later
- Add authGuard back later to routes after I can get Lucia to work


things I did since last meeting
- migrated file from js -> ts
- migrated from bad practice token/session mixed auth to session based auth with Lucia
- added seed script
- Added proper Pgn routes & model rather than pgn list on user object
