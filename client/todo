Bugs (frontend)
- get rid of green plus icon when drag hovering pieces
- put pgn generation in separate component
- make sure game can reset after a computer move

Bugs (backend related)
- Navbar is not updating on Home page (after login and redirect with url or button) even though there should be a cookie

Todo
- make nav bar prettier so game doesn't take up 100vh
- design & make UI for choosing between PGNs
- backend: adding kinda relational data so users can store PGNs
